# Challenges

This is a simple, straightforward collection of challenges I've either completed or am currently working on. They vary in language and complexity, from crafting algorithms design in Ruby & Javascript, to database design, to manipulating the DOM with jQuery, to API integration in bigger, more complex web applications.

Most of these challenges were originally part of the onsite curriculum at Dev Bootcamp. They are _not_ categorized according to Phase/week.
