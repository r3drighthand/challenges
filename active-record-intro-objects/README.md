# Active Record Intro: Objects

## Summary
In this challenge, we're going to explore the instance methods available to instances of our Active Record models. Up to this point, we've primarily been working with class methods for retrieving data from the database and writing data to the database. We've only touched a couple of instance methods (e.g., `#save`). In this challenge we'll take a look at what we can do with objects after we instantiate them.

```ruby
class Dog < ApplicationRecord
end
```

*Figure 1.* Code for the class `Dog`.

We will be working primarily with a pre-written, empty `Dog` class (see Figure 1 and the file `app/models/dog.rb`). There are no methods defined within the class itself. The behaviors that we'll explore in this challenge are inherited through its parent class, `ApplicationRecord`.


## Releases
### Pre-release: Setup
```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:create
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake db:seed
```
*Figure 2*. Setting up and seeding the database.

Before we begin inserting records into the database, we need to create our database. We'll seed it with a few records, too: three dogs and also a handful of ratings. All the files necessary for this are provided: the migrations and the seeds file. We simply need to run the Rake tasks (see Figure 2).

```
bundle exec rake console
```
*Figure 3*. Executing the Rake task to open IRB with our environment loaded.

We're going to work with our `Dog` class from within the Rake console. Let's begin by opening the console (see Figure 3). Once it's open, we can begin interacting with our models. As we work through each release, we should execute the provided example code ourselves and look at the return values.


### Release 0: Dog Attributes
```ruby
Dog
```
*Figure 4*. Returning the `Dog` class.

Running the code in Figure 4 will return the `Dog` class itself, and we will see displayed in parentheses a list of attribute names and types that are associated with the class. From where does Active Record build this list of attributes?

Active Record derives these attributes from the columns in the dogs table in our database. Every column in the database is considered an attribute. So, our dogs have a name attribute, a license attribute, a breed attribute, etc. These attributes are similar to the instance variables that we assign to our plain Ruby objects.


### Release 1: Getter and Setter Methods
```ruby
class Book
  attr_accessor :title

  def initialize(args)
    @title = args[:title]
  end
end

book = Book.new(title: "The Cat in the Hat")
book.title
# => "The Cat in the Hat"
book.title = "Green Eggs and Ham"
# => "Green Eggs and Ham"
book.title
# => "Green Eggs and Ham"
```
*Figure 5*. A plain Ruby object with getter and setter methods for the title.

When we assign an instance variable in our plain Ruby objects, we often provide methods for getting the value of the instance variable and also setting the value of the instance variable (see Figure 5). We might be more familiar with referring to these methods as reader and writer methods.

With an Active Record model, getter and setter methods are provided automatically. There's no need to create them ourselves. For every column in the database, Active Record provides getter and setter instance methods.

```ruby
tenley = Dog.find_by(name: "Tenley")
tenley.name
# => "Tenley"
tenley.breed
# => "Golden Doodle"
tenley.age
# => 1
tenley.age = 2
# => 2
tenley.age
# => 2
```
*Figure 6*. Using the getter and setter methods of an Active Record model.

In Figure 6, we're accessing the attributes of our Active Record `Dog` model; we get the values of the name, breed, and age attributes, and we set the value of the age attribute. As stated earlier, Active Record provides us with getter and setter methods for all of the object's attributes. Our `Dog` class is empty; we haven't defined any of these methods.

Going through Figure 6 in more detail, after we have our dog object assigned to the variable `tenley`, we're calling the `#name` instance method to *get* the value of the name attribute. The value of the name attribute is returned: the string `"Tenley"`. As with the name attribute, we're also able to get the value of the breed and age attributes—and would be able to get the value of any other column in the database.

In addition to getter methods, we are also provided with setter methods. Given an instance of `Dog`, we can *set* the value of any of its attributes. In this case, we're changing the age of our dog to 2. And after setting the new age, when we again get the age, we see that Tenley's age is now 2.


### Release 2: Persisting Attribute Changes
```ruby
jayda = Dog.find_by(name: "Jayda")
jayda.age
# => 3
jayda.age = 4
# => 4
jayda.age
# => 4

Dog.find_by(name: "Jayda").age
# => 3
```
*Figure 7*. Changing the age of a dog, but not updating the database.

In Figure 7, we retrieve the data for the dog named Jayda. We then proceed to update Jayda's age, increasing it from 3 to 4. However, when we retrieve the data for Jayda from the database a second time, Jayda's age is still 3.

When we set an object's attributes using setter methods, those changes are only applied to the in-memory Ruby object. Those changes are not automatically persisted in the database.


```ruby
jayda.save

Dog.find_by(name: "Jayda").age
# => 4
```
*Figure 8*. Saving a dog to persist changes to its attributes.

If we want to persist our change to Jayda's age, we need to call the `#save` method on the dog object (see Figure 8).

Because our `jayda` object already has an id, Active Record will not make an SQL `INSERT` query. Instead, our call to `#save` will result in executing an `UPDATE` query like `UPDATE "dogs" SET "age" = ?, "updated_at" = ? WHERE "dogs"."id" = ? [["age", 4], ["updated_at", "2015-07-15 18:57:41.762752"], ["id", 2]]`.

We've only changed the `age` attribute, but Active Record also updates the `updated_at` attribute. Active Record will handle working with the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields on its own. We don't need to worry about them.


### Release 3: Updating Multiple Attributes
```ruby
tenley = Dog.find_by(name: "Tenley")
tenley.age
# => 1
tenley.license
# => "OH-9384764"

tenley.assign_attributes(age: 3, license: "OH-1234567")

tenley.age
# => 3
tenley.license
# => "OH-1234567"
```
*Figure 9* Simultaneously updating a dog's age and license.

Sometimes we wan't to update multiple attributes at the same time. If we wanted, we could use an object's individual setter methods one at a time. However, Active Record provides methods for updating multiple attributes at once (see Figure 9).

`#assign_attributes` and `#update_attributes` both allow us to update the values of multiple attributes at one time. Can we guess the difference between them? One of the methods persists changes to the database while the other only updates the attributes of the in-memory Ruby object. Which one is which?


### Release 4: Removing Records from the Database
```ruby
rabid_dog = Dog.create(name: "Old Yeller", age: 5, breed: "Black Mouth Cur")
rabid_dog.destroy
```
*Figure 10*. Inserting and then removing a record from the database.

Sometimes we want to remove a record from our database. Given a dog object, we can remove its data from the database with the `#destroy` method (see Figure 10). When we call `#destroy` Active Record generates and executes a `DELETE` SQL query like `DELETE FROM "dogs" WHERE "dogs"."id" = ?  [["id", 4]]`.


### Release 5: Update Ratings Data
In this release, we're going to work with ratings. The seeds file was set up to seed the database with a handful of ratings.  We're going to update the data in the database.

This is a list of changes that we need to make. We need to be sure that all changes are persisted in the database.

- Judge 1 rated Dog 2's cuteness to be a 7. The cuteness rating was mistakenly entered into the database as a 6. Find the record where Judge 1 rated Dog 2, and update cuteness to be a 7.

- Judge 5 was found to be taking bribes. All ratings made by Judge 5 need to be removed from the database. Find and delete all ratings made by Judge 5.

- Dog 1 is the cutest dog in the entire world and should always receive a cuteness score of 10. Find any rating for Dog 1 where cuteness is not a 10 and update cuteness to be a 10.

- Judge 4 was recorded as having rated Dog 3 a 7 on coolness and a 4 on cuteness. The judge's id was recorded incorrectly; it was Judge 6 who made this rating. Find the record where Judge 4 rated Dog 3 and update the judge id to be a 6.

- Judge 2 rated Dog 2, but the cuteness and coolness scores were reversed. Coolness was entered as a 10, and cuteness was entered as an 8. These need to be reversed. Find the rating for Judge 2 and Dog 2 and update the cuteness and coolness ratings.


### Conclusion
In this challenge, we've discussed Active Record model attributes, which are more or less the values in the database. These attributes are the state of our objects—similar to instance variables in our plain Ruby objects. We've explored both how to get and set these values using the Active Record-generated getter and setter methods as well as other methods (e.g., `#update_attributes`). Most of the behaviors for Active Record models are centered around their attributes, so we need to be sure we understand how columns in a database table translate to behaviors in our objects.

We've previously looked at how to create new records in the database and read records from the database. In this challenge, we've now addressed updating and deleting records in our database. Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). These are the four basic functions for persisting data in a database, and they will form the backbone of our applications as we move forward through Dev Bootcamp. While these might still be somewhat new to us, we'll continue to build familiarity with them.
