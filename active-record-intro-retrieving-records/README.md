#Active Record Intro: Retrieving Records

## Summary
In this challenge, we will begin to explore Active Record models, the classes backed up by our database. We'll learn about some of the different methods available for getting records out of our database. We'll explore both the methods that we'll rely on day in and day out as well as some helpful options that we'll use less regularly. For a more comprehensive list of options, we can always reference the [RailsGuides document on the Active Record Query Interface][RailsGuides Query Interface].

```ruby
class Dog < ApplicationRecord
end
```
*Figure 1.* Code for the class `Dog`.

We'll continue working with the database schema that we built over the previous Active Record Intro challenges. We'll switch our focus from the database schema (i.e., migrations) to working with our models. We'll be working with the class `Dog` throughout the challenge (see Figure 1). The class is defined in the file `app/models/dog.rb`.

As we can see, the class itself is empty; we define the class, specify that it inherits from `ApplicationRecord`, and then close it. There are no methods defined within the class itself. All the methods we need for interacting with the database are inherited.

Among the inherited methods, are class methods for retrieving data from the database. We ask the classes to handle building instances of themselves based on the data in the database—for example, the class `Dog` builds dog instances based on the data in the dogs table. We are going to explore some of these class methods in this challenge.


## Releases
### Pre-release: Setup
```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:create
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake db:seed
```
*Figure 2*. Setting up and seeding the database.

Before we begin pulling data out of our database, we need to create our database and seed it with data. All the files necessary for this are provided: the migrations and the seeds file. We simply need to run the Rake tasks (see Figure 2).

When we run the Rake task to seed the database, we'll be inserting records into the dogs table. The code that is executed is written in the file `db/seeds.rb`. This file has been written to add three dogs to our database: Jayda, Tenley, and Eleanor.

```
bundle exec rake console
```
*Figure 3*. Executing the Rake task to open IRB with our environment loaded.

We're going to work with our `Dog` class from within the Rake console (i.e., IRB with our environment loaded). Let's begin by opening the console (see Figure 3). Once it's open, we can begin interacting with our models. As we work through each release, we should execute the provided example code ourselves and look at the return values.


### Release 0: All of the Dogs
```ruby
Dog.all
```
*Figure 4*. Retrieving all the dogs from the database.

Active Record provides a method for returning a collection of all the dogs in the database: `.all` (see Figure 4). `.all` is a class method that returns a collection of all of the records in the `dogs` table as instances of the `Dog` class. Calling `Dog.all` tells Active Record to generate and execute a SQL query, and we can see the query in the console output: `SELECT "dogs".* FROM "dogs"`. When the data is retrieved from the database, each record is mapped to an instance of the `Dog` class. All of the instances are placed in a collection, an object that acts like an array.


### Release 1: Dogs Where a Condition is Met
Sometimes we don't want all the records for a given model. In our example, we won't always need to get all the dogs out of the database. Maybe we only want the dogs with a specific name or dogs of a particular breed.

```ruby
Dog.where(age: 1)
```
*Figure 5*. Passing conditions to `.where` as a hash.

`.where` is a class method that can accept a hash argument that specifies the values of specific fields on the database table (see Figure 5). In this case, we want all the dogs whose age is 1. The SQL executed is equivalent to `SELECT "dogs".* FROM "dogs" WHERE "dogs"."age" = 1`.

The dogs table will be searched for any records that match our conditions. The assumption is that there could be more than one, so the `Dog` objects are returned in a collection—even if there is only one match.

```ruby
Dog.where("age = ? and name like ?", 1, '%Te%')
```
*Figure 6*. Passing conditions to `.where` as a string.

`.where` can also accept a string, as if we were writing part of the SQL query ourselves (see Figure 6).


### Release 2: Getting Dogs in a Certain Order
```ruby
Dog.order(age: :desc)
```
*Figure 7*. Ordering dogs by age from oldest to youngest.

Just as we might not always want to get all the dogs, sometimes we'll want to get dogs returned to us in a certain order: alphabetically by license, oldest to youngest, etc. `.order` allows us to retrieve records ordered by specified attributes (see Figure 7).


### Release 3: Limiting the Number of Records Returned
```ruby
Dog.limit(2)
```
*Figure 8*. Limiting the number of records returned to 2.

Sometimes we only want to return a certain number of records. When we visit a blog, we aren't shown every post ever written to the blog, but maybe only the most recent handful. `.limit` allows us to specify a maximum number of records to return (see Figure 8).


### Release 4: A Count of How Many Records Exist
```ruby
Dog.count
```
*Figure 9*. Retrieving a count of records in the dogs table.

In addition to retrieving records from the database, we can also ask an Active Record model to tell us how many records exist in the database with the `.count` method (see Figure 9).


### Release 5: Getting Specific Attributes
```ruby
Dog.pluck(:name, :age)
```
*Figure 10*. Retrieving the names and ages of the dogs.

We don't always need to get all of the data for our dogs. Perhaps we only need the names, or the license numbers. `.pluck` allows us to retrieve just the values of specified fields (see Figure 10).

In the methods that we looked at in earlier releases (e.g., `.all`), each record was mapped to an instance of the `Dog` class. And, the instances were grouped in a collection that was like an array. `.pluck` doesn't create `Dog` class instances; it just gives us the values we ask for.


### Release 6: Getting the First Dog
```ruby
Dog.first
```
*Figure 11*. Retrieving the first dog, ordered by primary key.

`.all`, `.where`, `.order`, etc. are methods that returned collections of objects. Sometimes we are interested in getting just one dog—not a collection of dogs. `.first` is one such method (see Figure 11). It returns the first record in the `dogs` table, ordered by primary key.

Optionally, you can pass an argument to get multiple objects back (e.g., `Dog.first(2)`); this would return a collection.


### Release 7: Finding a Dog by the Primary Key Value
```ruby
Dog.find(3)
```
*Figure 12*. Retrieving the dog with id 3.

If we want to find a single dog, and we know the value of its primary key, we can retrieve that dog using the `.find` method (see Figure 12). In our case, we're searching by `id`, since the `id` column is the primary key for the dogs table.

We can also specify an array of ID's, if we're looking for multiple records (e.g., `Dog.find [1, 3]`.

What happens if we try to find a dog by an id that is not in the database? An error is raised. In the console, this won't affect us too much, but if we were running an application, that error could be a problem. We need to be aware that `.find` could raise an error.


### Release 8: Finding a Dog by Attribute Values
```ruby
Dog.find_by(name: "Jayda")
```
*Figure 13*. Retrieving the first dog found with the name Jayda.

If we're trying to find a single dog, but we don't know the value of its primary key, we can search for it by an attribute whose value we do know. For example, we can search for a dog with specific name (see Figure 13) using the `.find_by` method.

`.find_by` is similar to `.where` in that we can pass it a hash of attribute values that it should match. However, `.where` returns a collection of all records that match the given conditions. `.find_by` will return a single instance—even if there are multiple matches in the database.

What happens if we try to find a dog by an attribute, but there are no matching records in the database? Remember that `.find` raises an error. How does `.find_by` behave?


### Release 9: Method Chaining
```ruby
Dog.order(name: :asc).where(age: 1).limit(1)
```
*Figure 14*. Chaining multiple methods together to specify which records to return.

We've been exploring each of these methods in isolation, but it's also possible to chain many of these methods together (see Figure 14). Active Record will interpret the method chain into one SQL statement: `SELECT "dogs".* FROM "dogs" WHERE "dogs"."age" = 1 ORDER BY "dogs"."name" ASC LIMIT 1`.

We just need to be careful because not all of the methods are chainable. For example, `.pluck`. We could tack a call to `.pluck` onto the end of the chain shown in Figure 14, and it would work just fine. However, we couldn't stick `.pluck` into the middle of the chain. Why not? What does it return compared to the return values of the other methods?


### Release 10: `Person` and `Rating` classes
We can now close the rake console. We're going to turn our attention to defining two more Active Record models: `Person` and `Rating`. Create these classes, and set them up like our `Dog` class to be Active Record models. Tests have been provided in `spec/models`.


## Conclusion
We've now been exposed to how we can use Active Record to pull data out of our database. Active Record provides a powerful interface for interacting with our database, and we're just beginning to explore it. As we move forward through Dev Bootcamp, we'll become more and more comfortable with the methods we explored in this challenge and be exposed to new methods.
