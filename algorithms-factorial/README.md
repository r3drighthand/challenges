# Algorithm Drill: Calculate a Factorial

## Summary
In this challenge I wrote two solutions to the same problem: calculating the factorial of a given number. Both methods behave the same way â€” they accept the same arguments and return the same values. They differ in their implementations. One is iterative and the other is recursive.
