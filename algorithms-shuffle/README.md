# Algorithm Drill: Shuffle

## Summary
Ruby provides multiple methods for changing the order of elements in an array.  For example, we have `Array#sort` and `Array#sort_by`.  If we want to randomize the order of the elements we can use `Array#shuffle`.

In this challenge, we're going to recreate the functionality of the `Array#shuffle` method.  Writing our own shuffle algorithm is a good way to explore iterating over collections.

If we're stuck trying to devise our own algorithm, we can try to implement the [Knuth Shuffle Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).


## Releases
### Release 0: Write a Method to Shuffle an Array

We're going to write a `shuffle` method that takes an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order—one important property of a good `shuffle` method is that every permutation is equally likely.

Tests have been written to describe the behavior of our `shuffle` method.  We can also run the driver code in the `runner.rb` file to check that the method truly does shuffle the elements in the array each time it is called.

*Note:*  While it's not required, we might want to use the [`#rand`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-rand) method.

**Rules and Constraints:**

- The point of this challenge is to delve into the algorithm, not to use a pre-built solution.  To that end, certain methods may not be used: `Array#sample`, `Array#shuffle`, and `Array#sort_by`.
- Our method will always change the order of the elements in its input.  While it is possible to shuffle a collection and end up with the elements in the same order, we will not permit this.
- Our method should not change its input (i.e., our method should be non-destructive).

## Conclusion
We'll be making use of a lot of functionality that is built into Ruby.  Still, it's good practice to think about how we would accomplish a task, if we had to write an algorithm ourselves. Even if we don't implement our ideas, it will give us a notion of what Ruby is doing. And because Ruby is open source, we can check our ideas against the one adopted by the language—though some may have been written in C.

Throughout Dev Bootcamp, we'll be balancing between writing our own solutions and adopting what's available to us, like Rails.  We'll see a pattern of writing our own implementations to get an understanding of how things work before moving on to the ready-to-use solution.
