# Anagrams 1: Detecting Anagrams

## Summary
In this challenge I wrote a method that tells me if two words are *anagrams*.

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example, we can spell *melon* by rearranging the letters in *lemon*. Therefore, melon is an anagram of lemon.  We could also say that lemon is an anagram of melon. Or, we could just say that lemon and melon are anagrams. Regardless of how we say it, two words are anagrams if we can rearrange the letters of one to spell the other.
