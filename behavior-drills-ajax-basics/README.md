# Basic Ajax

## Learning Competencies
* Use AJAX actions to change views based on asynchronous data
* Implement asynchronous requests in a web application
* Enter into an existing code base and extend it

## Summary
You are given migrations, models, seed data, and controllers. We're going to practice implementing the ajax portion only with the code that is already in place. **All the directions are in the app's javascript files**. Hints will be given below in the Releases section.

## Releases

### Pre-reading
Before you get started, read this [intro to ajax](http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/).

### Quickstart

1.  `bundle install`
2.  `rake db:all`
3.  `bundle exec shotgun`
4.  Navigate to `localhost:9393` and follow the instructions.


### Release 0: Implementing AJAX CRUD/RESTful Routes with partials

[This](http://api.jquery.com/serialize/) might be useful for submitting form data.

### Release 1: Simple AJAX GET and POST that returns json
Time to lookup what exactly [JSON](http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/) is.

You might need to find out what fired an event. Look at [this](http://api.jquery.com/event.target/).

## Things to think about
The following questions might help you get your bearings:

1. How do you intercept a form submission event using jQuery?
2. How can we prevent the default behavior of the event?
3. How do we do a generic AJAX call using jQuery?
4. How do we do a a shortcut AJAX GET or POST using jQuery?
5. What should we pass for the `url` argument? How about the `type` argument?
5. How do we pass data to the server when making an AJAX call?
6. When the server responds, what code gets run? How do we access the data that
   the server sends back?

If you cannot answer these questions, you'll have a tough time implementing
things. Take your time, use Google, and think it through!
