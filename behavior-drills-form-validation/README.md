# Behavior Drill Form Validation

## Learning Competencies
* Use jQuery
* Change the DOM based on events
* Use JavaScript to validate data in-client

## Summary
Forms are what allows users to send data to the server. They are much more
than just logging in and signing up for email newsletters.

When building forms, a critical component is ensuring that the collected data
is valid. There is no one definition of "valid", rather it is relative to the
purpose of the data. For example, if you are collecting someone's age in
years, it should probably be a numeric value like `26` rather than a word like
`older than you`.

In this challenge, you will be writing JavaScript to perform *client-side
validations*, i.e. validating form input on the client machine before the form
is submitted.

You will need the following tools:
- [The RegExp object in JavaScript][]
- [Basics of jQuery Events][] and [Event Handling][]

## Releases

### Release 0: Validate the Form
Write JavaScript code to validate the user input in each of the form fields.
An example of a 100% invalid form (i.e. all validation tests are failing) with
the corresponding error messages is shown below:

![Form Validation](http://f.cl.ly/items/1J1a203e092m2P1E3e3N/form_validation.png)

Your task is to write the JavaScript which will perform the validations listed
above. Here is some pseudocode roughly describing the expected behavior:

```text
	When the user clicks the "Sign Up" button
	They should be notified if any of the following conditions are NOT true
	- The email conforms to the standard pattern
	- The password has at least 8 characters
	- The password has at least one capital letter
	- The password has at least one numeric character

	If any of the above conditions are false
	- The form is not allowed to be submitted
	- Error messages are dislpayed
```

If you are having trouble writing a regular expression to match against the
email, look around online. There are plenty of examples out there.
