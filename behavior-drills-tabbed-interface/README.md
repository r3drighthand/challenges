# Behavior Drill Tabbed Interface

## Learning Competencies

* Change DOM state based on events
* Write custom event handlers in JavaScript and jQuery
* Communicate state changes via CSS and JavaScript

## Summary

Let's create a simple tabbed interface.

Take time to read over the CSS; it uses some intermediate techniques to get the
desired UI.

## Releases

### Release 0:  Add JavaScript to Make Tabs Live!

You can do what you need to do **without** editing the HTML or CSS.  It should
end up behaving like this: [Tabbed Interface](https://vimeo.com/123216091)

Edit the JavaScript in the tabs.js file.  [Peruse the jQuery API
documentation][jqueryapi] to find methods that will do what you
need.  Make sure you're clear on what you need, first, though. :)

**Do not use the [jQuery UI .tabs()](http://jqueryui.com/tabs/) function.**

### Stretch

Can you achieve the same functionality **without jQuery**? Remove the jQuery
`<script>` tag from `tabs.html` and use only the built-in DOM manipulation
functions provided by the browser.

Take a look at [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/)
for some relevant examples.
