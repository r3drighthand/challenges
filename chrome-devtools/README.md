Getting to know the Chrome Devtools
=========================

Select one of these tabs in the Chrome Devtools:

- Elements
- Network
- Timeline
- Resources

Take 30 minutes (at most) to become an expert on the tab and the value it provides. Prepare a 5 minute lightning talk on the tool. You'll deliver your talk to the cohort.

Try to ensure that someone is assigned to each tab, do not double up on tabs if possible.
