# Algorithm Drill: The Fibonacci Sequence

## Summary
In this challenge I'm once again  implementing the same behavior in two different ways: iteratively and recursively.

The behavior I'm after in this challenge is calculating a number in the Fibonacci sequence. The [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a specific sequence of numbers. The numbers in the sequence are observable in nature (if interested, see video [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0), [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIP_Z_-0Hs), and [Part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14-NdQwKz9w)), and the ratio between the numbers approximates the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) which has been [used in the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_designed_with_the_golden_ratio) for its aesthetic properties.

Why the interest in calculating numbers in the sequence? Not for the numbers themselves, but because the sequence represents a real-world system of rules that can be modeled in code.
