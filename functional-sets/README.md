# Functional Sets

In this challenge you'll produce a Set. We're defining the `Set` as "a function that accepts a number and returns a boolean." Or, in a fancier looking notation:

```
type Set = Function(Integer) => Boolean
```

## Constraints
Your Sets will only contain integers.

## Composability
As you produce functions, consider if they can be combined to implement others. In other words, can you implement some function _in terms of_ another? Look for and take advantage of these opportunities when appropriate.

## Tests
You'll need to write tests for each method you implement. You can run your tests with `node sets_test.js`.

## Release 1, Basic Operations
Define and test the following methods stubbed out in `sets.js`:
 - singletonSet
 - union
 - intersect
 - diff
 - filter

## Release 2, Operating on Collections
You have the basic set operations, now we want operations that can operate on the elements in the sets.
 - forall
 - exists
 - map
 - toString

## Release 3, Bounded
You'll notice these methods only operate on bounded integers. Why is this necessary? Describe your thoughts in `note.md`.
