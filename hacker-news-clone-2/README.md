* Implement CRUD in an MVC application
* Implement user login and authentication in a web application
* use AJAX actions to change views based on async

## Summary
What's Hacker News without voting?

Users should be able to up and down vote posts and comments. For now, you can have two separate tables for each type of vote.

## Releases

### Release 0: Models &amp; Controllers

At the very least you should have the following models:

1. `Post`
2. `User`
3. `Comment`
3. `PostVote`
4. `CommentVote`

Don't try to do something fancy and have `PostVote` and `CommentVote` inherit
from a shared base class. Just have two separate tables and classes for now.

### Release 1 : Views
Implement all the views and use AJAX to implement the voting.
