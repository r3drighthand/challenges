# Jasmine MVC Challenge

> Note: This challenge doesn't include Jasmine. You'll need to install the
> jasmine-rails gem. Be sure to write a simple test to verify everything is
> working.

## Models - Release 0
Create a `Tweet` model and write Jasmine tests for the following
functionality:

1. The model should have the following properties: `content`, `username`
2. The tweet's content must not be longer than 140 characters
3. For trademark reasons, the tweet must not contain the word 'twitter' or any links to the Twitter URL shortener, `t.co`. All mentions of 'twitter' should be replaced with 'tweety'
4. A single method should expose whether or not a tweet is valid or not. It's up
to you to decide what this method would return
5. Automatically add an '@' before the username if necessary

## New Tweet Form - Release 1
Create a view that replaces the existing new tweet form on the homepage. The tweet view must:

1. Use your Tweet model
2. Update the view to diplay a continually updated character count
3. Show an error message "Over limit" when more than 140 characters are entered
4. Show an warning message whenever Twitter is replaced with Tweety
5. Show an error message whenever a `t.co` URL is entered
6. Save the tweet to the server when the submit button is clicked
7. Reload the page when the new tweet has been successfully saved

*Note:*  It's not required to test these behaviors.


## Stretch
1. Replace the timeline view with additional views & write tests for them.
2. Add some sort of easter egg with Sylvester the Cat
