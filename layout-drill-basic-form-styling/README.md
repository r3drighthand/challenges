# Layout Drill Basic Form Styling

## Cool Stuff

* Edit presentation layer to achieve a new layout

## Summary
We're going to learn some fundamentals about styling a form.

The `./source` contains a basic HTML file for a product page, including:

1. A page header
2. Navigation links
3. Highlighted information about the product
4. A footer

You'll notice that the "Sign Up" form on the page looks like...not nice. Let's
fix that.

To achieve the desired effect, you will have to utilize some features of CSS3.


## Releases

### Release 0: That's a Fine-Looking Signup Form
Your task: use CSS to transform the existing grossness into something approximating the following:

![Awesome Form][]

Granted, this is not *the awesomest signup form of all time*, but it is a heck of
a lot better than the default style and it won't take you too much work.

What did we actually change?  Well, here is a short list of the new features:

- All form elements tucked into a tidy, centered box
- Form container has a gradient background and a border with rounded corners
- Input elements and submit button have customized widths so that they align nicely
- Input elements have placeholder text
- Submit button has customized color and "glow" effect achieved with the `box-shadow` property

*NOTE: You are allowed to edit the HTML in order to solve this challenge. You
shouldn't have to do too much more than remove the `<label>` elements, though.*
