## Summary
We're going to learn some fundamentals about webpage layout. You'll have a
fixed HTML file to work with and your job is to change the CSS and *only* the
CSS to achieve the desired layout.

The `blog.html` contains basic HTML that models a blog post, including:

1. A page header
2. A navigation bar
3. The blog post content
4. A footer

If you're not familiar with floating in CSS, you might need to take time to read these resources:

As closely as you can, edit the `main.css` file so that the blog post now looks like this:

<a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/3j0W3Q0M0O2X2N160j13/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-16%20at%207.12.18%20PM.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3j0W3Q0M0O2X2N160j13/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-16%20at%207.12.18%20PM.png" width="780"></a>

The entire page is `720px` wide; don't change that. The entire `.content` area should be `600px` wide, including any padding and borders. The `h2` which includes the blog post title should be flush against the top of the content
area.

The left-hand navigation should be `120px` wide including any padding and borders. The list items should not have any bullets and the navigation elements should be flush against the left-hand side of the page.

The footer text should align with the start of the content text and there should be `20px` of space between the footer text and both the bottom of the content area and the bottom of the page.
