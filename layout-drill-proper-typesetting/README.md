# Layout Drill Proper Typesetting

## Learning Competencies
- Implement fonts and typographic styling in CSS
- Change basic CSS appearance: colors, widths, padding, margin

## Summary
We're going to learn some fundamentals about styling elements on a web page. You'll have a set of fixed HTML files to work with and your job is to change the CSS and *only* the CSS to achieve the desired effects.

The `./source` directory contains a set of files meant to represent a blog
article that spans multiple pages.

If you open up any of the `page*.html` pages (the `*` represents any character), you'll find that they follow this format:

1. The name of the blog
2. A title for the article
3. The article body, broken up into sections
4. A very ugly pagination link area
