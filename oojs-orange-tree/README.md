# OOJS: Model an Orange Tree

## Summary
I modelled an orange tree in Ruby; in this exercise I built JavaScript objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

Unlike Ruby, JS uses prototypal inheritance, so method lookup isn't quite the same. JavaScript doesn't have classes, so when an object itself doesn't have a property, one can't look in the class, parent class, grandparent class, etc.  Instead, JavaScript objects inherit properties from their prototypes.
