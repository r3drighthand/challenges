# Schema Design: Reddit

## Summary
This challenge provides another opportunity to practice designing a database schema. In this case, we'll be given a list of user behaviors that a web application should allow; we'll design a database schema to support the site.


## Releases
### Release 0: Design the Schema
We're going to design a schema to support a web application. The web application is a junior version of [Reddit](http://reddit.com). Take a quick look at the site, if it's not familiar.

As noted, we're designing a schema for a junior version of Reddit, not the full site.  Our schema should support an application that allows users to do the following:

- A user can submit stories.
- A user can vote stories up or down.
- A user can comment on stories.
- A user can comment on comments.

Visually model the schema. You can't use Schema Designer because Kaplan shut down DBC because they're a bunch of jerks. Figure it out. Submit a screenshot of the completed schema design.
