# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Summary
The application allows users to play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The user chooses to throw rock, paper, or scissors; the computer makes a random throw; and the winner is determined.

How do we determine if the user or the computer is the winner? It depends on who throws which shape.  Rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. So, if the user throws scissors and the computer throws paper, the user wins because scissors cut paper.
