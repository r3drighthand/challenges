# Roman Numerals

##Summary

We're going to write a method that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent. In other words, if we give our method the Arabic number 476, our method will return the Roman numeral CDLXXVI.

Determining how to take any number (e.g., 1, 58, 1948, etc.) and convert it into its Roman numeral equivalent is our main focus. But, in solving this problem, we'll have the opportunity to practice developing with a test-first approach. And, as always, we should pay attention to the quality of the code that we write. Are we writing methods that do only one thing? Is our code DRYâ€”as in *don't repeat yourself*? Are we giving our variables descriptive names? We need to be very deliberate with our code to make it as easy to read as possible; make intentional decisions.

### Test-first Approach
At Dev Bootcamp we take a test-driven approach to development. Before we write code, we're going to write tests that will tell us if the code we do write is operating the way that we expect it to.
