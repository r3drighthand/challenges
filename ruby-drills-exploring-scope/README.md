# Ruby Drill: Exploring Scope

## Summary
When we write our applications, we create objects: strings, arrays, hashes, custom objects, etc.  After creating an object, we often want to use it later in our program. So, we define a variable and assign our object to the variable.

We have different options when defining variables: global variables, constants, local variables, instance variables, and class variables. Each of these options will affect when and how we're able to access stored data.

The question we'll explore in this challenge is "Where are our variables visible?". In more technical language, we might ask, "What is the *scope* of a variable?". We'll explore and refine our understanding of scope in Ruby.


### Changing Scope
Our programs begin executing in a top-level scope. Some code triggers a change in scope. For example, using the keyword `module` when defining a module changes scope, and the code defining the module is executed within this new scope. Then, when the class definition is complete, our program returns to the previous scope. Another example is when we call a method, the method is executed in a new scope. When the method is finished executing, our program again returns to the previous scope and continues.

When scope changes, we lose access to some variables, as we'll see.


## Releases
### Release 0: Global Variables
Global variables are the easiest to understand when it comes to scope. That is because they have visibility everywhere. In other words, scope changes have no effect on whether or not a global variable is accessible. We can access them and reassign their values anywhere in our code.

We're going to demonstrate working with global variables with the provided `TipCalculator` module. Look at the code for the module (see `tip_calculator.rb`). We can see that the module has a method that returns the value of a global variable `$global_tip_percentage`. It also has a method that reassigns the value of that `$global_tip_percentage`.

Open IRB and ...
1. Check the value of `$global_tip_percentage`.  It should return `nil`, since we haven't assigned it a value. This should be unsurprising because IRB doesn't know anything about the file `tip_calculator.rb` and the module defined inside it.
2. Assign a value to our global variable: `$global_tip_percentage = 0.15`.
3. `load 'tip_calculator.rb'`. When the module definition is executed, the value of `$global_tip_percentage` is reassigned to be `0.2`.
4. Check the value of `$global_tip_percentage`.  It should have been changed to `0.2`. Theorize why this might have changed. An explanation is at the bottom of this file.
5. Ask the `TipCalculator` for the customary percentage. It should return `0.2`, the value of `$global_tip_percentage`.
6. Assign a new value to our global variable: `$global_tip_percentage = 0.25`.
7. Ask the `TipCalculator` for the customary percentage again. It should return the value we just assigned to the global variable.
8. Ask the `TipCalculator` to set the customary percentage: `TipCalculator.customary_percentage = 0.3`, which will again reassign the value of our global variable.
6. Check the value of `$global_tip_percentage`. It should have changed to the value we just supplied.
7. Exit IRB.


To reiterate, global variables are always accessible. We've assigned and accessed the value of a global variable in the top-level scope, while a module was being defined, and from within methods. No scope change prohibited our ability to access, _and change_, the global variable.

As we might imagine, relying on global variables whose values are subject to being changed at any time by any object can cause unexpected results and difficult to debug problems. Therefore, it's best practice not to utilize global variables, if it can be avoided.


### Release 1: Constants
Constants are variables whose values are meant to be ... constant. In other words, we don't reassign their values. Conventionally, constants are written in all caps with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MINIMUM_HEIGHT`). However, any variable that just begins with a capital letter is considered by Ruby to be a constant.  For example, classes and modules are considered constants as well, though we use different conventions for their names (e.g., `Person` or `HeightValidator`).

As with global variables, constants are always accessible in our programs. However, depending on the scope in which the constant has been defined, it might not be as straightforward to access as a global variable.

We're going to demonstrate working with constants with the provided `RideHeightCalculator` module.  Look at the code for the module (see `ride_height_calculator.rb`). In the code, we begin by defining a constant, `PARK_NAME`. We then define a module and within the module define a series of constants (e.g., `ROLLER_COASTER_MINIMUM_HEIGHT`).

Open IRB and ...
1. Check the value of `PARK_NAME`. Unlike global variables, which default to `nil`, trying to access an uninitialized constant will raise an error.
2. `load 'ride_height_checker.rb'`
3. Check the value of `PARK_NAME`. Now that it's been declared and assigned, we can get its value.
4. Check the value of `ROLLER_COASTER_MINIMUM_HEIGHT`. Again we get an error.  Because this constant was declared within a module, we can't access it directly. Its _scope_ is inaccessible.
5. Check the value of `RideHeightChecker::ROLLER_COASTER_MINIMUM_HEIGHT`. Because we defined this constant within the `RideHeightChecker` module, we can go _through_ that module to access it, making use of the namespace operator, `::`.
6. Exit IRB.
7. Look at the code for the private method `minimum_height_for_type`. The constants are being accessed there without referencing the name of the module. That's possible from within the module definition itself—the same would be true for a class definition. But, as we saw, from outside the module definition, the constants are only accessible by using the module as a namespace (e.g., RideHeightChecker::ROLLER_COASTER_MINIMUM_HEIGHT).


*Note:*  Technically, the value of a constant can be changed, but doing so would violate convention, and Ruby will warn us.


### Release 2: Local Variables
In contrast to global variables and constants which are accessible throughout our programs, local variables are accessible only within the scope in which they are defined. Any time scope changes, we're working with a new set of local variables; because of this, it's helpful to understand when changes in scope are triggered.

We'll explore the visibility of local variables by writing some code in IRB. So, open IRB and ...

1. Check the value of `self`. It should be `main`, indicating that we're working in the top-level scope.
2. Define a local variable in the top-level scope: `status = :curious`.
3. Access the value of the local variable:  `status`. We haven't changed scope, so we have access to our top-level local variable.
4. Write a method to return the value of our variable:

  ```ruby
  def current_status
    return status
  end
  ```

5. Run the method: `current_status`. What does the error message tell us? There is no local variable `status`. Why not? Because we've changed scope and lost access to the local variables in the top-level scope.
6. Overwrite the `current_status` method so that it defines its own `status` local variable:

  ```ruby
  def current_status
    status = :intrigued
    return status
  end
  ```

7. Run the method: `current_status`. We see that it returns `:intrigued`, the value of the local variable `status` within the scope of the method.
8. Has this affected the value of the top-level local variable `status`?  Access the value of `status`. Its value has not been changed. As we know, it's out of scope when our method runs.
9. Rewrite the method again so that it has one parameter:

  ```ruby
  def current_status(status)
    return status
  end
  ```

10. Run the method: `current_status(:inquisitive)`. It returns the argument, `:inquisitive`. If we define a method with parameters—in this case one parameter named `status` — the parameters become local variables when the method runs. When we then call the method, the arguments we pass to it are assigned to local variables—in this case, `status`.
11. Given that method parameters act as local variables when the method runs, would having a parameter named `status` interfere with our top-level variable `status`? Access the value of `status`. Was it affected?


This is by no means an exhaustive exploration of local variables, but it should provide a foundation for understanding how changes in scope affect the visibility of local variables. The key takeaway is that anytime scope changes, there is also a change in the set of local variables which are visible.


### Release 3: Instance Variable
We've worked with instance variables in previous challenges. Instance variables are named beginning with `@`. For example, `@name`, `@date_of_birth`, etc. We use them to hold state for individual objects. If we have a class `Employee`, we would use the instance variable `@name` to hold the name of each unique instance of `Employee`.

The visibility of instance variables is very limited. They are only visible to the object to which they belong. If we want an object to share the values of its instance variables, we create accessor methods to expose them.

We're going to explore a little more about instance variables. We'll be working with the provided `Dog` class. Take a moment to review the file `dog.rb`. Notice that when a new instance of the class `Dog` is created, three arguments are expected, and then each is assigned to an instance variable. Then, each of the instance variables is exposed through a long-hand accessor method.

Open IRB and ...
1. `load 'dog.rb'`.
2. Create a new instance of the class `Dog`:

  ```ruby
  jayda = Dog.new('Jayda', 'English Bull Terrier', 'OH-123456')
  ```

3. Ask the new dog for its name: `jayda.name`.  And, the object returns the value of its `@name` instance variable. In the body of the method `Dog#name`, we make no reference to any particular object, we just ask for `@name`. Presumably, there could be any number of objects with the instance variable `@name`. How is it determined which object's instance variable to return?
4. Check the value of `self`. It should be `main`.
5.  Check the value of `@name`.  What is it?  It should be `nil`.  Just like global variables, instance variables which have not been assigned a value return `nil`.
6. Assign `@name` a value: `@name = 'Sam'`.
7. Check the value of `@name`. It should return `'Sam'`. We know that instance variables are internal to an object. To which object does this particular `@name` instance variable belong?
8. Check our dog's name to see if it's changed:  `jayda.name`. It should not have been altered.
9. Define a method directly on our top-level object (i.e., `main`) to return its instance variable `@name`:

  ```ruby
  def self.name
    @name
  end
  ```

10. Call the method on `self`: `self.name`. What is returned? `'Sam'`. When were were accessing and assigning instance variables in the top-level scope, we were dealing with the instance variables of `self`. And that's always the case.  When we access or assign an instance variable, we do so from or to whichever object `self` refers.  Just as `self` is the default receiver of method calls, it is also the object we deal with when working with instance variables.


### Release 4: Class Variables
As with global variables, there are not many situations where we would want to rely on class variables, but they do exist, so we'll take a look. Class variables are named somewhat like instance variables, only they begin with `@@`.

The key thing to understand about class variables is that they are visible to a class and all instances of that class. We'll explore class variables using the supplied `Borg` class. Take a look at the class. The class definition begins by setting a class variable `@@borg_count`. We also define a class method `Borg.count` which returns the value of the class variable. And later we define an instance method `Borg#name` which accesses the value of the class variable `@@borg_count`. Again, class variables are shared between the class itself and all instances of the class.

*Note:* The Borg are a fictional alien race in the _Star Trek_ franchise. They operate with a hive mind, so an individual Borg conceivably knows how many Borg there have been (`@@borg_count`). Individual Borg are typically referred to by numbers such as Third of Five and Seven of Nine. Personally, I can't ever enjoy Star Trek after whatching the _Black Mirror_ episode "USS Callister".

Open IRB and ...
1. `load 'borg.rb'`.
2. Check how many borg have been created: `Borg.count`.
3. Create a new instance of the class: `one = Borg.new`.
4. Check how many borg have been created: `Borg.count`. It's been updated to show that a borg has been created.
5. Ask our `Borg` instance for its name: `one.name`. It should return `'1 of 1'`, which demonstrates that just like the class, this instance has access to the class variable. What about another instance?
6. Create another instance of the class: `two = Borg.new`.
7. Ask it for its name: `two.name`.
8. The name of our first `Borg` instance is calculated based on the value of the class variable. Has it now changed? Check: `one.name`.
9. Does the `Borg` class itself access the updated value as well? Check: `Borg.count`.

Again, class variables are shared between a class and all instances of that class. We won't discuss it here, but class variables are also shared with child classes. That's one variable shared among potentially a whole host of objects, which could lead to problems in the same way that the misuse of global variables can lead to problems. Class variables are a part of Ruby we should understand, but in most cases they're better left unused.


## Conclusion
This was a whirlwind tour of scope in Ruby, addressing the visibility of different types of variables. The better we understand how each type of variable operates, the better decisions we can make with regard to which type of variable to use. As we write more and more Ruby, dealing with scope and variable visibility will become more and more second nature, but along the way there might be some bumps in the road.

## Explanations
Point 4: The `load` command opened the `module` scope and found, inside, a reference to a global, `$global_tip_percentage`. Thus is changed or _mutated_ the value from the 0.15 _you_ entered to the `0.2` that was defined in
`tip_calculator.rb`.
