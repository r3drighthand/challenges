# Ruby Racer: Outrageous Fortune

## Summary
This is a simple "game" called Ruby Racer that runs on the command line, but there's no strategy or decision making, just luck.

The game is a race between two players.  Both players start at the beginning of the track, side-by-side.  Players take turns rolling a die and advancing along the track until one of them reaches the end of the track and wins the game.

This was an exercise in state management (keeping track of player positions), and transforming data structures (transforming data into a printable board).
