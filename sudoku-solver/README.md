# Sudoku

## Summary
[Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes") contains the digits from 1 to 9.

Generally, a puzzle provides a partial solution so that some squares already have numbers. To solve the puzzle, one needs to fill in the unsolved squares.

This challenge is an attempt to write a fully functioning Sudoku solver that runs on the command line. There are 15 unsolved Sudoku puzzles represented as strings.

The restrictions for this challenge include:

- No classes.
- No instance variables and no globals.
